# qdata

This is a WIP fork of OpenQASM which aims to add a few additional features:

* specification of operators as linear combinations of other operators
* measurement of these operators supported directly in the grammar

Optional features to consider:

* declaring quantum channels in a similar way to quantum gates
* basic measurement post-processing like expval?
* remove the unnecessary restrictions on uppercase names
* support for complex numbers?
* support for gates & operators to be declared as matrices? (similar to quil)
